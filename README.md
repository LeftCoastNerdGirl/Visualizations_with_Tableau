# Data Visualizations with Tableau

The abiity to determine what data tells the story and how to visualize that story is key to data analytics.  

For this project, the students used Tableau as the data visualization tool. The following is a list of key questions to consider when preparing the workbook:  

-How many trips have been recorded in total during the chosen period?  
-By what percentage has total ridership grown?  
-How have the proportions of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed?  
-What are the peak hours when bikes are used during the summer months?  
-What are the peak hours when bikes are used during the winter months?  
-Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? Based on data, why do you hypothesize these are the top locations?  
-Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? Based on data, why?  
-Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? Based on data, why?  
-Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? Based on data, why?  
-How does the average trip duration change by the type of user? (This may be under "User Type" or "member_casual" depending on the period the data is from).  
-What is the average distance in miles for a bike trip?  
-Which bikes (by ID) are most likely due for repair or inspection in the timespan?  
-How variable is the utilization by bike ID?
